For users using the App.py file in source or compiling: replace utils.py from pydub with the one in this folder.
the utils.py file you need to replace can be found in the .venv folder at .venv/Lib/site-packages/pydub. 
DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REPLACE UTILS.PY IN THE BASE ENVIORNMENT THAT PYTHON COMES WITH!

The purpose of using this is to make the pydub library use the ffmpeg.exe file in the ffmpeg folder instead of trying to use ffmpeg from the system.
This makes it so that the user doesn't have to install ffmpeg on their computer to use the app.
